                    <P>
                        My name is Steven Tran, and I'm currently looking for a career in the direction of
                        a full-stack web developer. I have studied at the University of Toronto with a major
                        in computer-science and have experienced using the following programming languages:
                        Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C# and C++. I am looking forward to reinforcing my 
                        knowledge and building a presentable portfolio at the UofT SCS Coding Bootcamp.
                    </P>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Aside from working and playing around with computers and programming, my core skillset
                        and interests revolves around being able to create things. My hobbies involves making
                        replica props from various media and building scaled plastic or 'paper' (cardstock) models.
                        With this said, I have a future interest in a branching career path either into the gamming
                        or animation industries. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fun Fact: My other hobby is archery, and I can't wait for the weather to be good enough
                        to hit the range again.
